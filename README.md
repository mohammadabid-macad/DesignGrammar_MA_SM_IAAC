# Project Description

In this project, we explore pattern filling on a grid using Graph Machine Learning. The dataset is generated using random LEGO brick placements, and the patterns are converted into DGL (Deep Graph Library) graphs. We employ a custom GraphSAGE hybrid model to predict brick placements through self-supervised learning. The key objectives of this project are to create complex pattern-filling strategies using Graph ML, embedding features for bricks and edges, and training models on the resulting graphs.
Folder Structure

    BrickLayerX_2000/: Contains the dataset of 2000 generated patterns, DGL graphs, and features in .pkl format.
    DesignGrammar_DatasetCreation_BricklayerX.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for generating patterns and creating the dataset.
    DesignGrammar_SelfSupervised_Hybrid_Model_Training.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for embedding features and training the Graph ML model.

# Using the Notebooks
# Dataset Creation Notebook

    Purpose: The DesignGrammar_DatasetCreation_BricklayerX.ipynb notebook generates random brick patterns, converts them into graphs, and extracts features for use in training.
    Steps in the Notebook:
        Initialize the grid and random insertion points.
        Generate patterns and fill the grid with LEGO bricks.
        Convert the patterns to DGL graphs and extract node and edge features.
        Save the dataset and features as .pkl files.

# Model Training Notebook

    Purpose: The DesignGrammar_SelfSupervised_Hybrid_Model_Training.ipynb notebook loads the dataset, embeds features into the graphs, and trains the custom GraphSAGE hybrid model on the data.
    Steps in the Notebook:
        Load the DGL graphs and feature files.
        Embed node and edge features into the graphs.
        Define and train the GraphSAGE model.
        Visualize the training and validation results.
        Save the trained model and its results.

# Results and Visualization

    After training the model, the results are visualized by plotting the training/validation loss and accuracy.
    The model predictions are applied to random test patterns, and the results are displayed to show the pattern-filling efficiency of the trained GraphSAGE model.
